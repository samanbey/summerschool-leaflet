# 03 – Fetching data from files or web services

## Loading GeoJSON data

Loading files in JavaScript usually means fetching data from the web. (Don't forgt that the html file is hosted on a remote web server, but it is displayed on your computer in the browser.) 
In JavaScript the ```fetch()``` function can be used for this. This function works asynchronously, which means you have to define functions that will be called when the task is ready. 

Once the data is fetched, we simply use the L.geoJSON() function which creates a layer group from the features in the data:

``` javascript
            // fetch sample GeoJSON data
            fetch('../data/hun_counties_pop.geojson')
                .then(r => r.json()) 
                    // after the response arrived, extract data as a json object
                    .then(d => { 
                        // when data extraction is ready, create a geojson layer from it
                        var gj = L.geoJSON(d)
                            .addTo(map);
                        map.fitBounds(gj.getBounds());
                    });
```

Notice that we fit the extent of the map to the extent of the loaded data.
In this example the sample data is county polygons of Hungary with some attribute data. It is advisable to add the 'name' attribute as a tooltip to polygons.
The ```bindTooltip()``` method of the GeoJSON layer awaits eiher a string (then all features will have the same tooltip text) or a function, which gets the layer object as a parameter and should return the tooltip text.
The feature properties can be found in the ```layer.feature.properties``` object:

``` javascript
            // tooltip function for sample data - retrieves the value of the 'name' property
            function tt(layer) {
                return layer.feature.properties.name;
            }
```

Don't forget to use it in ```bindTooltip()```:

``` javascript
                        // when data extraction is ready, create a geojson layer from it
                        gj = L.geoJSON(d)
                            .addTo(map)
                            .bindTooltip(tt);
```

## Task 1
Create a web map which loads the [sample GeoJSON data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/hun_counties_pop.geojson) and displays it. The 'name' property should be used as tooltip.
