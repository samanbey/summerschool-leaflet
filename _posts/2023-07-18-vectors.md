# 02 – Adding markers and vectors; layers control

## Markers
Adding a marker (a "pushpin") to the map is very simple using the ```L.marker()``` function:
``` javascript
            // add a marker
            var m = L.marker([47.4749, 19.0622]).addTo(map);
```

## Popups, tooltips
You can bind a popup (an info window that appears on mouse click) or  tooltip (a small hint text that appears on mouse hover) to markers:

``` javascript
            // bind tooltip
            m.bindTooltip('You are here');
            
            // bind popup
            m.bindPopup('This is the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformatics, venue of this Summer School').openPopup();
```
