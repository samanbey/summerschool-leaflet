# 02 – Adding markers and vectors; layers control

## Markers
Adding a marker (a "pushpin") to the map is very simple using the ```L.marker()``` function:
``` javascript
            // add a marker
            var m = L.marker([47.4749, 19.0622]).addTo(map);
```

## Popups, tooltips
You can bind a popup (an info window that appears on mouse click) or  tooltip (a small hint text that appears on mouse hover) to markers:

``` javascript
            // bind tooltip
            m.bindTooltip('You are here');
            
            // bind popup
            m.bindPopup('This is the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformatics, venue of this Summer School')
                .openPopup();
```

Tooltip and popup content may also contain HTML formatting. 
The openPopup() method opens the popup window (it might come in handy to have it opened when loading the page.)

## Task 1
Create an advertisement page for a fisherman who is selling his fish from a boat on Lake Balaton. 
The ad should contain a map, displaying the position of the boat (46.88682, 17.90299). Bind a popup with opening hours and a picture to the marker.
You can use [this sample image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fish_boat.jpg) if you need

## Polygons
Adding a polygon to the map is also very simple. Use the ```L.polygon()``` function and specify the polyagon coordinates as an 'array of arrays':

``` javascript
            // add a polygon
            var a = L.polygon([[46.92, 17.91],[46.97, 18.12],[46.94, 17.93]])
                .addTo(map);
```

## Task 2
Also indicate the area wher the fisherman catch fish. The bounding coordinates are: [[46.9056, 17.9578],[46.9239, 18.0553],[46.9769, 18.1260],[47.0054, 18.056],[46.9422, 17.9291]]

## Layers control
